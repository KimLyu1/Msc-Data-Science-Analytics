# AAPL is doing well, going from $5 per share to nearly $30 per share, reflecting sideways its popularity with investors. But it has not always been on the rise, and recent years have reflected a downward trend. Between 2014 and 2015, for example, its share price reached a peak, followed by a repetition of declines and rises again year on year. Overall, however, the trend is one of constant upward movement.

chartSeries(MSFT, TA='addATR();addBBands();addCCI();addRSI()')
# The size of the customer base of Microsoft, one of the earliest Internet companies, was huge and as a result there were few who invested in the company. After the financial crisis of 2008, its share price fell to around $10 for a while, but then the economy recovered and it has risen to 60 per share in recent years. For a share price, it is considerably higher than AAPL, but the general trend for MSFT is up.
```
In the previous step I applied four indicators to the plot, which are:

- *ATR* indicates Average True Range and is an indicator used to measure the volatility of prices, i.e. an indication of the rate of change in the market. In the early days it was mostly used in the futures market, but is now also used in equities, foreign exchange, etc. The higher the ATR indicator, the greater the chance of a price trend reversal, and the opposite holds true.
 
- *BBands*: Usually, during a share price turnaround, the most important thing that investors want to know must be how long the share price ticket will consolidate before it generates a market. This is because if the stock is bought too early and the stock does not rise, the utilisation of capital is reduced and the investor has to bear the risk of a fall in the share price. This is where the Bollinger Bands indicator can work its magic and give the right indication of the end of a consolidation. The indicator draws three lines on the graph, the upper and lower lines can be seen as pressure and support lines respectively, and between the two lines there is an average price line, preferably set at 20, which generally runs in a channel formed by the pressure and support lines.
 
- *CCI* Commodity Channel Index: Specially measures whether a stock price has fallen outside of its normal distribution. In general, buy when CCI rises above 100; sell when CCI falls below -100.
 
- *RSI*: The Relative Strength Index RSI is a measure of the speed and variability of price movements. and oscillates between 0 and 100. In general buy when the RSI value is above 70 and sell when it is below 30.

# ARIMA preparation

## 1.Testing and ensuring stationary

To model a time series using the ARIMA method, the series must be smooth. A smooth time series represents a time series with no trend, where one has a constant mean and variance over time, which makes it easy to predict values.

*Testing stationary* - We test for stationary using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test. For a smooth time series, the p-value obtained by the ADF test must be less than 0.05 or 5%. If the p-value is greater than 0.05 or 5%, it can be concluded that the time series has a unit root, which means that it is a non-stationary process.

*Differencing* -In order to convert a non-smooth process into a smooth one, we apply the difference method. Differentiating time series means finding the differences between successive values of the time series data. The difference values form a new time series data set, which can be tested to find new correlations or other interesting statistical properties.

We can apply the difference method several times in succession to produce "first order differences", "second order differences", etc.

Before we proceed to the next step, we apply the appropriate order of difference (d) to smooth the time series.

```{r}
adf.test(AAPL$Adjusted)    # AAPL's Adjusted is not a stable sequence
adf.test(MSFT$Adjusted)    # MSFT's Adjusted is not a stable sequence
```

```{r}
# Differentiate the sequence to smooth the sequence (here we start using the training set)
## AAPL
AAPL_adj <- ts(train_AAPL$Adjusted, frequency = 252)
AAPL_adj_diff <- AAPL_adj %>% diff() 


# plot and adf test
plot(AAPL_adj_diff)
adf.test(AAPL_adj_diff)   # p-value less than 0.05, so it's a stable sequence

## MSFT 
MSFT_adj <- ts(train_MSFT$Adjusted, frequency = 252)
MSFT_adj_diff <- MSFT_adj %>% diff() 


# plot and adf test
plot(MSFT_adj_diff)
adf.test(MSFT_adj_diff)   # p-value less than 0.05, so it's a stable sequence
```

## 2.Identifying p and q

In this step, we determine the appropriate order for the autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) processes by using the autocorrelation function (ACF) and the partial autocorrelation function (PACF).

*Identifying the p-order of an AR model*

For the AR model, the ACF will decay exponentially and the PACF will be used to identify the order (p) of the AR model. If we have a significant peak at lag 1 on the PACF, then we have an AR model of order 1, i.e. AR(1). If we have significant peaks at lags 1,2 and 3 on the PACF then we have a 3rd order AR model, i.e. AR(3). (usually only the first 5 orders are looked at)

*Identifying the q-order of the MA model*

For the MA model, the PACF will decay exponentially and the ACF plot will be used to identify the order of the MA process. If we have a significant peak at lag 1 on the ACF, then we have an MA model of order 1, i.e. MA(1). If we have significant peaks at lags 1,2 and 3 on the ACF then we have an MA model of order 3, i.e. MA(3). (usually only the first 5 orders are looked at)
```{r}
## AAPL
acf(AAPL_adj_diff, main = "AAPL ACF Plot")    # There is a significant peak at lag 1, i.e. MA = 1 and q is 1
pacf(AAPL_adj_diff, main = "AAPL PACF Plot")  
# There are significant peaks at lags 4, 5 respectively, i.e. AR = 2, p for 2

## MSFT
acf(MSFT_adj_diff, main = "MSFT ACF Plot")    # There is a significant peak at lag 1, i.e. MA = 1 and q is 1
pacf(MSFT_adj_diff, main = "MSFT PACF Plot")   # There is a significant peak at lag 4, i.e. AR = 1 and p is 1
```
## 3.Estimates and forecasts

Once we have determined the parameters (p, d, q), we can estimate the accuracy of the ARIMA model on the training dataset and then use the fitted model to predict the values of the test dataset using the prediction function. Finally, we cross-check that our predicted values are consistent with the actual values.
```{r}
## AAPL
### Constructed using automatic selection parameters
AAPL_autoArima <- auto.arima(AAPL_adj)
AAPL_autoArima
checkresiduals(AAPL_autoArima, lag = 5)   # It's white noise

### Constructed using manually selected parameters
AAPL_Arima <- Arima(AAPL_adj, order = c(2,1,1))
AAPL_Arima
checkresiduals(AAPL_Arima, lag = 5)   # It's white noise

## MSFT
### Constructed using automatic selection parameters
MSFT_autoArima <- auto.arima(MSFT_adj)
MSFT_autoArima
checkresiduals(MSFT_autoArima, lag = 5)   # It's white noise

### Constructed using manually selected parameters
MSFT_Arima <- Arima(MSFT_adj, order = c(1,1,1))
MSFT_Arima
checkresiduals(MSFT_Arima, lag = 5)   # It's white noise
```

## 4.Use of model predictions
```{r}
# AAPL 
## auto.arima
AAPL_autoArimaforecast <- forecast(AAPL_autoArima, h = 417)    # the length of test set
plot(AAPL_autoArimaforecast)
x <- autoplot(AAPL_autoArimaforecast, series = "Predicted", color = "blue") +
  autolayer(ts(AAPL$Adjusted, frequency = 252), series = "Actual") +
  theme_light() +
  ylab("AAPL Adjusted Closing price")


## Arima manually
AAPL_Arimaforecast <- forecast(AAPL_Arima, h = 417)    # the length of test set

  autolayer(ts(AAPL$Adjusted, frequency = 252), series = "Actual") +
  theme_light() +
  ylab("AAPL Adjusted Closing price")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(x, y, ncol = 2)

# MSFT 
## auto.arima
MSFT_autoArimaforecast <- forecast(MSFT_autoArima, h = 417)    # the length of test set
plot(MSFT_autoArimaforecast)
autoplot(MSFT_autoArimaforecast, series = "Predicted", color = "blue") +
  autolayer(ts(MSFT$Adjusted, frequency = 252), series = "Actual") +
  theme_light() +
  ylab("MSFT Adjusted Closing price")

## Arima manually
MSFT_Arimaforecast <- forecast(MSFT_Arima, h = 417)    # the length of test set
plot(MSFT_Arimaforecast)
autoplot(MSFT_Arimaforecast, series = "Predicted", color = "blue") +
  autolayer(ts(MSFT$Adjusted, frequency = 252), series = "Actual") +
  theme_light() +
  ylab("MSFT Adjusted Closing price")
```

## 5.Test the distribution of their predicted residuals
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# AAPL
## auto.arima
ggplot(data.frame(Residuals = AAPL_autoArimaforecast$residuals), aes(x = Residuals)) +

  geom_density(alpha=.2,fill="blue") +
  theme_light() +
  ggtitle("Residuals of Arima and Auto.arima Model MSFT")
```
The forecast errors appear to be normally distributed with zero mean and constant variance, and the ARIMA model does appear to provide an appropriate forecasting model.
